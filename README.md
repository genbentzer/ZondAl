Written in Python, all files are easy to read.  The config file is easily modified allowing the user to enter IP ranges, and selected victim wallet keys and destination wallet.

I have been working on the code for just under a year and I am still adding code to bypass security features that are being implemented In Oversea and Crypto Services.

The CLI is powerful, allowing for an array of attacks for each pass.  It is very verbose and the captures can be saved in a .txt file or an encrytped cap.  The GUI that comes with it is simple and reflects everything you can do with the CLI.  Windows and Mac have been tested but mostly and extensively tested in Linux.  I do not foresee any problems in Windows and Mac that would not arise in Linux, as it is Python code.

The various functions I have included are a clipper, a keylogger for those users who are a bit more careful, a modifier to alter the victims wallet (key and phrase) to your own (a simple cycle is built in for a range of your own wallets), Firewall avoidance (for a combination of hardware and software firewalls) and you can add custom payloads for backdoor injection.  I have also included some payloads that still work for me.  All this works over TOR so obviously DO NOT use this while reading gmails.  I have included standard encryption but it is easy to add your own to experiment with.  And your decrypted files will be perfectly readable.
Plus, all the easiest checks are done first, like searching for wallets enabled in browsers.

My software detects the addressing scheme and algorith automatically.  You can change it if you want but I do not know why you would - but the option is there.  Could become in useful in the future.

As you can imagine, the files are large.  Mostly because the seperate binaries are.  I am helped with the binaries and my colleagues require payments.
